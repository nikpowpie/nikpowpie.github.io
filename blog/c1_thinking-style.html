      According to the Gregoric Thinking Style test, my thinking style is abstract random. Now, when I first realized this. I was bit alarmed. But I thought about it and figured, you know what. It makes sense. I do like to listen to others, I have a friendly demeanor, I absolutely love working backwards or jumping around when working, and sometimes I feel like I have to do multiple things at once (although now, I'm learning multi-tasking is a no-no).
    </p>
    <p>
      According to Gregoric, Abstract Random Thinkers organize information through reflection, and thrive in unstructured, people-oriented environments. Which is why writing about experience in learning or life, helps solidify the event for me. It also helps organize my thoughts. To get rid of the unnecessary and gather and keep the valuable moments from the experience.

      I think my biggest struggle with learning code, having a thinking style such as mine, has been not having the human aspect, while learning. Not being able to listen to someone figure out something, or bounce a concept off of someone immediately.  While I work well alone, it's nice to have a classmate there to discuss something that's confusing or difficult to grasp.
