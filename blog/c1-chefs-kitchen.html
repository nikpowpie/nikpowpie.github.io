  <h1>the DBC experience</h1>
  <h2>reflecting on DBC's culture.</h2>
  <h4>March 21, 2015</h4>

  <section>
    <p>
        I’m so ready to be a programming line cook. Or whatever you call the entry-level person in the kitchen. Maybe that’s dishwasher? I don't know. Needless to say, after watching Shereef’s fireside chat on what kind of mindset to bring to DevBootcamp, I’m hoping to put to rest that entitled restaurant mindset and, hop into the kitchen where I can get my hands dirty.
      </p>

      <p>
        Based on the video, I can tell DBC puts and emphasis on authenticity and transparency. It’s refreshing, really, because it seems as though the staff wants to foster an environment of openness in learning without feeling the need to compare or compete with anybody but yourself. The total opposite of what I experience in education even through my college years. The majority of my education, I was told what I should learn, how I should learn it and try to be better and faster than other people. Truthfully, it's exhausting, and perpetuates the fixed mindset that Carol Dweck's study examines. So I'm beyond delighted at the prospect of being able to take over my own education, and learn the way that works best for me.
      </p>

      <p>
        On the other hand though, it’s also a bit scary. With DBC being such an intense program, I can already foresee there will be moments where I will be met face to face with my weaknesses, on top of that, I’ll have to admit them. Having to be vulnerable with people I don’t know and expose my flaws in such a manner, makes a bit nervous. Sometimes, I catch myself having those thoughts, that question my success with the program. Like, what if I just don't get the material? What if I'm so overwhelmed and so excited that I freeze up and chicken out?!
        </p>

      <p>
        Nevertheless, I am optimistic and believe with effort and strategy, I will thrive in the DBC environment. I have the propensity to excel in creative-learning, people-focused settings like fully immersive study abroad programs (my grades where higher when I took my learning to non-english sepaking countries). After all, I am an abstract-random thinker.
      </p>

      <p>
        Abstract-random thinkers are known for heighten instincts and intuition. They also love feedback, and opportunities to creatively collaborate with others which, in a sense, defines the DBC experience as a whole. A place where others work together for a common goal, and make stuff. I’m excited about it.
