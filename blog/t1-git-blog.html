      I feel like I’m dabbling into some of the nitty gritty of web developer territory. This week, I learned about a version control program called git. Before we hop into git, What’s version control you ask? Version control is just that, a means to control versions of files. In other words, version control tracks changes you make to a file, saves them in a series of checkpoints or snapshots for you to access later; where you can test, use, merge or discard, the choice is yours.
      </p>

      <p>
      You also may ask, why do I need version control? The answer is simple really. You want to share your work and collaborate with others but you don’t want to break stuff. Version control is great because with all this feedback, sharing and code being thrown all over the place, it helps keep us programmers organized. A good version control system should monitor how your code is being changed. It should make it easy to get feedback on your code, make it easy to make changes and, if you mess up, it should let you cycle back to old versions of your file. This means you can experiment with new features without completely ruining your program or spending hours debugging because you forgot a semicolon.
      </p>

      <p>
       Now on to Git. Git itself is a free program, and is downloaded to your computer via the command line accessed through the terminal of your MAC computer. Using a series of git commands the git program saves your file changes, allows you to access different versions of that file and lets you make new changes to a file without altering the original or master file in anyway.
      </p>

      <p>
        Examples of commonly used Git commands include git init, which initializes Git’s tracking in your current directory. Git add, which adds our files to the staging area BEFORE you bookmark, or create a checkpoint for this file. Then the famous git commit command, which can be customized with a description of our own using message flag, -m. Git commit saves your changes separate from the master file, and is a checkpoint for you to access later when you’re ready to git push or git merge your files to a remote repository. What’s even better is that you can create a branch of a git file. Using the git branch command, you can create a variation of a commit if you just want to test or check something out and can also be merged later if you decide to move forward with it.  What’s the best place to store all these wonderfully tracked git files might be the next question rolling around in your noggin, well that’s next.

        Github, is the programmer Facebook. It is exactly what the name suggests a hub, of git tracked files. It’s a magical place where programmers push code files from their projects up from their local computers to the cloud. This is so they can accessed anywhere there is an internet connection and viewed by a colleague, friend, or anybody who’s interest. Github keeps copies of the files you git push up to their remote repository on their server. Because Github is accessible online and it’s fancy interface clearly indicates file names and recent changes it is perfect for sharing your projects with other people to make your work collaborative. This is exactly why developers (and project managers) love Github. It helps track all changes made by every person that has access to your code. In this way it ensures nobody breaks, loses, has access to change or override any code that’s already working.
      </p>

      <p>
        Another great thing about Github is that it’s a distributed version control system. This means that copies of the code are saved on multiple computers versus a centralized control system where the source code is saved in one place. Which is a BIG sigh of relief to those who fear their projects will disappear.

        WOO! We have finally reached the end of Nikki’s Intro to Git and Github. That was alot, right? Yet and still so much to learn. Until next post!
